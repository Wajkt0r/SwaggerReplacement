## 🧩 Scalar [localhost:port/scalar/v1]

### 1. 🔐 Authentication support

Unlike SwaggerUI or OpenAPI-UI (when using Microsoft's OpenAPI generator), Scalar allows choosing and applying authentication methods out of the box — including working support for Bearer tokens. 
This worked even in .NET 10 with OpenAPI-generated specs, without any manual changes.
